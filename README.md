There are a number of really useful tools that the Shopify Themes team uses during development. Dawn is already set up to work with these tools.

### Shopify CLI

[Shopify CLI](https://github.com/Shopify/shopify-cli) helps you build Shopify themes faster and is used to automate and enhance your local development workflow. It comes bundled with a suite of commands for developing Shopify themesâ€”everything from working with themes on a Shopify store (e.g. creating, publishing, deleting themes) or launching a development server for local theme development.

You can follow this [quick start guide for theme developers](https://github.com/Shopify/shopify-cli#quick-start-guide-for-theme-developers) to get started.

### Theme Check

We recommend using [Theme Check](https://github.com/shopify/theme-check) as a way to validate and lint your Shopify themes.

We've added Theme Check to Dawn's [list of VS Code extensions](/.vscode/extensions.json) so if you're using Visual Studio Code as your code editor of choice, you'll be prompted to install the [Theme Check VS Code](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=Shopify.theme-check-vscode) extension upon opening VS Code after you've forked and cloned Dawn.

You can also run it from a terminal with the following Shopify CLI command:

```bash
shopify theme check
```

### Continuous Integration

Dawn uses [GitHub Actions](https://github.com/features/actions) to maintain the quality of the theme. [This is a starting point](https://github.com/Shopify/dawn/blob/main/.github/workflows/ci.yml) and what we suggest to use in order to ensure you're building better themes. Feel free to build off of it!

#### Shopify/lighthouse-ci-action

We love fast websites! Which is why we created [Shopify/lighthouse-ci-action](https://github.com/Shopify/lighthouse-ci-action). This runs a series of [Google Lighthouse](https://developers.google.com/web/tools/lighthouse) audits for the home, product and collections pages on a store to ensure code that gets added doesn't degrade storefront performance over time.

#### Shopify/theme-check-action

Dawn runs [Theme Check](#Theme-Check) on every commit via [Shopify/theme-check-action](https://github.com/Shopify/theme-check-action).
